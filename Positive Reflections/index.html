<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Corruption is not an easy topic. This entity is everywhere in my country,
   you can see it at school, at your working place, walking on the street.
   In fact, corruption is omnipresent and omnipotent. To deal with it, one must
   be able to identify it and realize that a personal attitude change is the 
   only way out of the viscious circle that it represents. But, how can we 
   recognize that corruption is present in our actions? how can we 
   eventually change the social principles with our attitude change? Well, 
   in the next paragraphs I will present some examples that are common in
   modern life and some suggestions on how to tackle this situations will
   be also attached. CHIP</p>
